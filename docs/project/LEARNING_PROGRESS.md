## üéì Confirmed Understanding

### Database & Mongoose (Tested November 1, 2025)

**Quiz Score:** 87.5/100

**Concepts Confirmed:**

- ‚úÖ MongoDB query operators (`$ne`, `$gte`, `$lte`, `$or`, `$in`, `$all`)
- ‚úÖ Mongoose query methods (`find()`, `findOne()`, `findById()`, `findByIdAndUpdate()`, `updateOne()`)
- ‚úÖ Understanding return values (array vs document vs stats)
- ‚úÖ Building complex queries with multiple conditions
- ‚úÖ Date range queries
- ‚úÖ Searching within arrays

**Areas for Improvement:**

- üî® Syntax precision (missing `await`, extra curly braces)

---

## üéØ Review Plan

**Goal:** Be able to explain and implement any feature from scratch in an interview setting.

### Review Sessions (After Frontend Completion)

Each section will be reviewed with:

1. **Explanation Test** - Explain the concept as if in an interview
2. **Implementation Challenge** - Build a small related feature from scratch
3. **Troubleshooting Scenario** - Debug a hypothetical issue
4. **Quiz/Questions** - Answer targeted questions about the implementation

### Review Order

**Priority 1 (Core Interview Topics):**

1. Authentication & Authorization
2. Backend Architecture (API design, middleware)
3. Database Design (schemas, queries)
4. Security Implementation

**Priority 2 (Supporting Knowledge):** 5. Frontend Architecture 6. Core Concepts & Architecture 7. Project Overview

**Priority 3 (Nice to Know):** 8. Demo System 9. Email System 10. Scheduled Tasks 11. Testing 12. Deployment 13. What I'd Do Differently 14. Future Features
