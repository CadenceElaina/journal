**Review Schedule:**
After completing frontend journal features (Phase 1.7), we will:

1. **Concept Review Session** (1-2 hours)
   - Walk through each feature explaining implementation
   - Review backend concepts with practical examples
   - Test understanding with scenarios/challenges
2. **Knowledge Assessment**
   - Quiz on frontend React patterns
   - Scenario-based questions on authentication flow
   - Explain security decisions and trade-offs
3. **Interview Preparation**
   - Practice explaining project architecture
   - Walk through challenges solved
   - Discuss what you'd do differently
4. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update LEARNING_PROGRESS.md with new concepts mastered
   - Document any remaining knowledge gaps
   - Create action plan for addressing gaps

**Goal:** Be confident explaining any part of the project in technical interviews and apply these concepts to future projects.

**Current Learning Status:**

- Backend Understanding: 85-90% ‚úÖ
- Mongoose Queries: 87.5% ‚úÖ (quiz completed Nov 1)
- Frontend Understanding: 40-50% üî® (in progress)
