**Overall Progress: Phase 1 - ~70% Complete**

### ‚úÖ Fully Complete:

- **Backend Infrastructure**: 100% complete and production-ready
  - All API endpoints functional
  - Authentication, authorization, and security
  - Email verification & password reset systems
  - Demo system with auto-cleanup
  - Advanced search/filter/sort/pagination
- **Frontend Authentication Flow**: 95% complete
  - Login, SignUp, Password Reset UI
  - Email verification after signup
  - Provider onboarding (3-step process)
  - All context providers integrated
  - Demo login functionality wired

### üî® In Active Development:

- **Core Journal Features**: 20% complete (skeleton phase)
  - Component structure created but mostly empty
  - JournalEntryForm has basic form setup
  - JournalList connected to context but no display logic
  - Search/Filter/Sort components are placeholder stubs

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues:

- Onboarding form submission bug (being fixed - Enter key in TagInput)

### üéØ Immediate Next Steps:

1. Fix onboarding Enter key submission bug ‚úÖ (patches applied, needs testing)
2. Build out JournalEntryForm with tag/mood inputs
3. Implement JournalCard to display individual entries
4. Wire up SearchBar and FilterPanel to JournalsContext
5. Create proper Dashboard with journal list
6. Add create/edit journal pages
