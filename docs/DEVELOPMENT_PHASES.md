# Journal App Development Phases

## Phase 1: Core MVP

**Goal:** Build a functional personal journal app with authentication

### Backend: âœ… COMPLETE & PRODUCTION READY

- âœ… User registration and login (JWT authentication)
- âœ… Password reset system (email-based with 6-char codes)
- âœ… Refresh token system (7-day tokens, auto-renewal)
- âœ… Full CRUD operations for journal entries
- âœ… Comprehensive validation (schema + auth)
- âœ… Tags for journal entries (array support, filter by multiple)
- âœ… Mood tracking (array support, multiple moods per entry)
- âœ… Filter journals by date (exact date + date ranges)
- âœ… Search journals by text (MongoDB text search on title/content)
- âœ… Demo system (isolated sessions, auto-cleanup, activity tracking)
- âœ… Advanced features:
  - 6 sort options (newest, oldest, edited, alphabetical, word count)
  - Pagination (page/limit support)
  - Word count tracking (auto-calculated)
  - User isolation (security - users only see their journals)
  - Ownership verification (can only edit/delete own entries)
